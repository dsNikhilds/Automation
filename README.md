# Automated recording of AdcScaler values

I have automated recording of AdcScaler values from https://iris00.triumf.ca/SC/AdcScaler to selected google sheets.

I have also included a link on how to setup the google sheets API authentication to allow automation.

You have to pass the row number value in the function. It tells the program to write the Adc Scaler values on that row. You may have to adjust the column value too depending on the googel sheets.
